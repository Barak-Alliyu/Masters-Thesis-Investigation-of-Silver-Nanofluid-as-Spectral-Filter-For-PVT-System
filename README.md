# Masters-Thesis-Investigation-of-Silver-Nanofluid-as-Spectral-Filter-For-PVT-System
MATLAB code for simulation of the thermal and electrical energy distribution of a solar cell using a silver nanofluid spectral beam.
## Files
This project consists of a "Main Matlab Code" folder that has the MATLAB code for simulating the entire PVT system. It also consists of a number of sub-codes, named after the function each performs. For instance, the file "AirProperties" consists of equations used to compute the air properties used in the main simulation while the file "h_convection" calculates the convective heat transfer coefficient.
