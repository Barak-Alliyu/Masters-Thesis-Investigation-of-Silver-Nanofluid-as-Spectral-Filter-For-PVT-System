# Masters-Thesis-Investigation-of-Silver-Nanofluid-as-Spectral-Filter-For-PVT-System
MATLAB code for simulation of the thermal and electrical energy distribution of a solar cell using a silver nanofluid spectral beam.
## Description
The project consists of a photovoltaic thermal (PVT) system, where there is a silver nanofluid enclosed between two thin glass layers in a water channel. This whole setup is then placed on top of a solar panel. The purpose of the nanofluid is to filter the solar radiation and only wavelenghts with the right amount of energy to pass through to the solar panel, while the others are absorbed by the nanofluid. The water will then tranfer this heat ou tof the system.

## Files
This project consists of a "Main Matlab Code" folder that has the MATLAB code for simulating the entire PVT system. It also consists of a number of sub-codes, named after the function each performs. For instance, the file "AirProperties" consists of equations used to compute the air properties used in the main simulation while the file "h_convection" calculates the convective heat transfer coefficient.
